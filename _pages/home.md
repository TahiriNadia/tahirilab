We are a dynamic research group within [the Department of Computer Science at the University of Sherbrooke](https://www.usherbrooke.ca/informatique/personnel/corps-professoral/).

Our lab focuses on transdisciplinary research aimed at understanding species evolution. By developing advanced metrics and algorithms for phylogenetic and lineage trees, we analyze genetic information in conjunction with climatic and other ecological parameters to reveal deeper insights into evolutionary processes.


 **We are  looking for passionate new PhD students, Postdocs, and Master students to join the team** [(more info)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/openings) **!**

# MISSION 
The research of Professor Nadia Tahiri focuses on establishing robust mathematical and statistical foundations to address the complex problem of phylogenetic tree classification and clustering. She is also dedicated to developing an open-source platform for biologists, enabling them to apply these cutting-edge methods. This work involves defining new optimization criteria for constructing multiple alternative consensus and supertrees using clustering algorithms and key phylogenetic tree metrics.

Our lab research is centered around three key objectives to build a computational framework for studying gene evolution:
1. **Development of efficient algorithms** to classify and construct a set of plausible alternative consensus and supertrees that accurately represent the data.
2. **Investigation of evolutionary patterns** in Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases to uncover deeper biological insights.
3. **Design and implementation of an open-source software platform** that will contain all algorithms developed in our lab, alongside both real and simulated datasets.

The long-term goal of our lab is to create an innovative, systematic, and automated approach for reconstructing diverse scenarios of genetic evolution in species groups affected by reticulate evolutionary events. This research will significantly contribute to the inference of alternative subtrees within the tree of life, providing valuable insights into the biodiversity and evolutionary relationships of all living organisms.

<!-- 
The mission of our lab is to develop projects in partnership with communities living in a changing environment to assess the impacts of anthropogenic pressures on health and well-being. To investigate these associations, we are using an ecosystem approach combining information from multiple levels of biological organization. Anthropogenic pressures lead to rapid and significant changes in the environment, posing a threat to public health especially for vulnerable populations. Several studies confirm that some communities are disproportionately affected by environmental changes. Many of these communities have expressed concerns about the potential health effects of changes in their environment, but few have received support and guidance from researchers in implementing research projects based on their concerns. 

Our lab highlights community knowledge as a valuable source of information in order to explore the relationships between environmental factors and health. We use an innovative participatory approach combining toxicology, molecular biology, community-based research, exposure assessment, epidemiology and environmental health.
