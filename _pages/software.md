  Our research center is interested in the effects of the environment on biodiversity. In order to understand how the environment affects biodiversity, it is necessary to apply integrative principles. The strength of our center therefore involves the development of a multidisciplinary vision necessary to develop tools for the analysis and management of biodiversity in a changing environmental context. The majority of students and researchers at our Centre use long-term ecological monitoring to understand how spatio-temporal variations in the environment affect the species that live there.

  Our team is dedicated to creating innovative software solutions that facilitate advanced research in biodiversity and environmental science. Below are some of the key software tools developed by our lab, designed to support and enhance phylogeographic and genetic analysis.

  aPhyloGeo is a command-line Python library designed for researchers to analyze the intricate relationships between genetic variations in viruses and geographical features, including climate data. This tool is particularly valuable for phylogeographic studies, which aim to understand how genetic diversity is distributed across different spatial scales. By leveraging aPhyloGeo, researchers can gain deeper insights into the evolutionary processes that shape genetic diversity and how these processes are influenced by environmental factors. The library's robust capabilities facilitate comprehensive analyses, making it an indispensable resource for advancing our understanding of the complex interplay between genetics and geography.

  To learn more about aPhyloGeo, visit the [Github repository](https://github.com/tahiri-lab/aPhyloGeo){:target="_blank"} or the [PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/aPhyloGeo/){:target="_blank"}.
