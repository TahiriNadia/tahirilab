## [Metrics for comparing lineage trees]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/lineage)

*Developing innovative computational methods to advance the understanding of the human immune system.*
   
The B cell lineage tree captures the intricate stages of B cell differentiation and maturation, starting from hematopoietic stem cells and progressing to mature, antibody-secreting cells in the immune system. From a mathematical perspective, this process can be represented as an evolutionary tree, where each node signifies a unique stage in B cell development, and the edges trace the differentiation pathways. A central focus of this research project is the development of an innovative metric for the comparative analysis of lineage trees. This metric employs a rigorous mathematical framework to quantify temporal changes in lineage attributes, thereby enhancing the precision of comparative assessments. In addition, the project encompasses the refinement of a classification algorithm designed to systematically categorize lineage trees based on their structural characteristics.
By advancing the accuracy of both comparative analysis and classification, this research contributes to the creation of predictive models crucial for the advancement of targeted immunotherapies and vaccines.
