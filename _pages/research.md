### [I. Building alternative consensus trees and supertrees]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/classification)

*Consensus tree and supertree inference methods synthesize collections of gene phylogenetic trees into comprehensive trees that preserve main topological features present in the input gene trees and include all taxa present in them.*
   
<!-- Consensus tree and supertree inference methods synthesize collections of gene phylogenetic trees into comprehensive trees that preserve main topological features present in the input gene trees and include all taxa present in them. We introduced a new systematic method for inferring multiple alternative consensus trees and supertrees from a given set of phylogenetic trees, which can be defined either on the same set of taxa (case of multiple consensus trees) or on different sets of taxa with incomplete taxon overlap (case of multiple super-trees). The inferred alternative consensus trees and supertrees represent the most important evolutionary patterns characterizing a given set of gene phylogenies and are usually much better resolved than a single consensus tree or supertree inferred by traditional methods. Thus, a multiple consensus tree or supertree inference approach has the potential to build supertrees that retain much more plausible information from the input gene trees. A single consensus tree or supertree could be an appropriate representation of a given set of gene trees only if all of them, or a large majority of them, follow the same evolutionary patterns. The presented method allows one to identify ensembles of genes that underwent similar hor-izontal gene transfer, hybridization and intragenic/intergenic recombination events, or those that were affected by similar ancient duplication events during their evolution. -->

### [II. Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) Modeling]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/qsar)

*The increasing diversity of environmental chemicals in the environment, some of which may be developmental toxicants, is a public health concern.*
<!--The increasing diversity of environmental chemicals in the environment, some of which may be developmental toxicants, is a public health concern. The aim of this work was to contribute to the development of rapid and effective methods to assess prenatal exposure. Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) modeling has emerged as a promising method in the development of a predictive model for the placental transfer of contaminants. Fetal to maternal plasma or serum concentration ratios for 105 chemicals were extracted from the literature, and 214 molecular descriptors were generated for each of these chemicals. Ten predictive models were built using Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software, and the Python and R programming languages. Training and test datasets were used, respectively, to build and validate the models. The Applicability Domain Tool v1.0 was used to determine the applicability domain. The models developed with the partial least squares regression method in MOE and SuperLearner in R, showed the best precision and predictivity, with internal coefficients of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) of 0.88 and 0.82, cross-validated R<sup>2</sup><sub>s</sub> of 0.72 and 0.57, and external R<sup>2</sup><sub>s</sub> of 0.73 and 0.74, respectively. The inclusion of all test chemicals by the domain of applicability demonstrated the reliability and relevance of the model predictions. The results obtained demonstrate that QSAR modeling can help quantify placental transfer of environmental chemicals. -->

### [III. Exploring the patterns of evolution]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/example)
*Horizontal gene transfer and recombination are widespread reticulate evolutionary processes contributing to the diversity of bacteria and viruses, allowing them to overcome selective pressure and to adapt to new environments.*

### [IV. Phylogeography: Evolution and climat]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/climatic)
*The genetic and demographic phenomena, in particular the phenomena of speciation, which have led to the distribution and the current geographic structuring of populations, involving paleography, is particularly promising for making predictions on emerging viral pathogens.*


### [V. Data and software]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/software)
*Developing new tools is often necessary to address new questions. Our team develops statistical and mathematical approaches, implements them and releases them as open-source software to ensure reproducibility and reliability of analyses.*
